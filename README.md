# skychaser

SkyChaser is a system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that allows a UAV to follow an object using a physical tracking sensor that communicates its location to the UAV.

The code in this repository is a program that allows an Arduino Nano to interact with various hardware components in the tracking sensor including a GPS module, altimeter, and
radio transmitter.
